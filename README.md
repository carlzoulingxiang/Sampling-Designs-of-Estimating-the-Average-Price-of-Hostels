Maximizing the use of the travel budget is often the most important thing that travellers consider. Nowadays, instead of staying in a hotel, there is also a large number of travellers tend to choose hostels as their accommodation because of the low cost and decent quality. Hostels are no longer just for lone backpackers and group of students, but it is also becoming popular among older adults, families and even business traveller who only have a tight budget. 

As all of our group members have never been to Japan before, we are planning to visit Tokyo, the capital city of Japan. For accommodations, we consider price as our priority as we do not have plenty of budgets and we are interested in how the hostels help us saving money than other lodgings. In this project, we use different sampling design strategies to estimate average pricing of hostels in Tokyo, then compare it to the average pricing of hotels and Airbnb to see if it is more affordable for us. The data set we use contained a total of 127 different hostels in Tokyo, and corresponding information for each hostel. After variables selection, we choose price per night as our variable of interest and distance from the city center as our auxiliary variable.
